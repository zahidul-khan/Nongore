1. Problem
Yelp is the largest website that contains huge amount of data. In this problem we have to offer flexibility to the user by they can choose restaurant in Helsinki area according to several categories like review count, distances, ratings and prices.
2. Method
For scrapping data from Yelp website I am using their API. But I have faced problem when using the API because they have disconnected API v2 for new user so I have to use their new Fusion API.
3. Libraries
I have used the following libraries to complete the task
1. requests (2.12.1) for communication and making requests from website
2. pandas for data structures and analysis
3. pyplot from matplotlib for graph plotting
4. urlencode from urllib for working with URL
